# Custom Homebrew Formulae

This is a tap for [homebrew](http://brew.sh) containing some custom formulae I wrote and wanted to share.

To add this to your taps (available homebrew repos):
```
brew tap alexkli/tap
```

Then install via:
```
brew install <formula>
```

or using the tap-specific name if there are conflicts:
```
brew install alexkli/tap/<formula>
```
